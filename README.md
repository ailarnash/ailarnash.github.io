# User Experince Researcher

### About
As an experienced user researcher with over five years in the field, I possess a refined skill set in planning, designing, facilitating, and synthesizing user research studies. My collaboration with diverse, multidisciplinary teams has allowed me to develop a deep understanding of user behavior and preferences. I leverage this knowledge to provide valuable insights and actionable recommendations that enable teams to create more effective and user-friendly products. My primary research interest centers on user experience research, as I believe that enhancing user engagement is critical to the success of digital products and services. I am dedicated to exploring innovative ways to identify the factors that influence user engagement, such as usability, user interface design, and content strategy. By partnering with your organization, we can work together to develop creative solutions that elevate the user experience and drive the success of your products or services. I am excited to connect with you to discuss your goals and interests in this area.

### Previous Experinces	
- As a UX researcher, I have had the opportunity to work on several research projects that have helped me develop a range of research approaches, methodologies, and results. 
Below are some detailed case studies that showcase my research process and the outcomes that resulted from each project.

- Canvas Learneing Managment System Website Study
In response to our client's request to enhance the website's navigation system, we employed a mixed-methods approach to gather data and insights that would inform the improvement process. We initiated the study by administering an online survey to collect quantitative data on the browsing habits and preferences of users. Subsequently, we conducted a series of one-on-one interviews with selected participants to gain deeper qualitative insights on their opinions about the current navigation system. Finally, we employed a remote usability testing tool to monitor and evaluate the real-time interaction of users with the website's navigation system. Our comprehensive research revealed that users encountered difficulties in using the Canvas learning management system, finding it complicated and confusing. Additionally, users preferred a more straightforward and intuitive system that would facilitate quick and easy access to information without having to navigate through multiple pages. Based on these findings, we recommended a simplification of Canvas's features and a restructuring of the system to align more closely with users' browsing habits and preferences, thereby enhancing user engagement and usability.

- Canvas Mobile Application User Experience Study
The aim of this study was to enhance the user experience of a mobile application to augment user engagement. A qualitative research approach was employed to obtain insights into the experience of using the app. In-person interviews were conducted with users to gain a comprehensive understanding of their experience. Furthermore, a competitive analysis was performed to identify best practices that could be applied to the app. Our research findings demonstrated that users found the app interface to be cluttered and overwhelming, which led to difficulties in navigation and finding relevant information. To address these issues, we recommended simplifying the app interface, enhancing specific features, and reducing the amount of clutter present in the app.

- Identifying Key Drivers of Customer Loyalty for a Retail Store
We aimed to identify the key drivers of customer loyalty for a retail store in order to develop effective marketing campaigns. To achieve this goal, a mixed-methods research design was employed. Firstly, a customer loyalty survey was conducted with a sample of 1,000 customers to identify the factors influencing their loyalty to the store. Secondly, a series of in-depth interviews were carried out with loyal customers to gain deeper insights into their experiences with the store. Thirdly, a statistical analysis was performed to identify the main drivers of customer loyalty. Finally, a competitive analysis was conducted to compare the strengths and weaknesses of the store with its competitors. The findings revealed that the quality of customer service and the store's product selection were the key factors that influenced customer loyalty. The research team recommended that the store should provide training to employees to enhance their responsiveness to customer needs and expand its product range to better meet customer requirements. As a result of implementing these recommendations, the store's customer loyalty rate increased by 25% and sales increased by 12%. These results suggest that the adoption of the recommended strategies could enhance customer loyalty and improve the financial performance of the store.
