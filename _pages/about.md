I am a second year M.Sc. student at [IUST](http://www.iust.ac.ir/en), working under the supervision of [Dr. Shahrokh Farahmand](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=wulBErEAAAAJ&hl=en), Assistant Professor at Iran University of Science and Technology. Mesmerized by the power of deep learning, I try to formulate various problems through the lens of AI and bring that statistical perspective to them. In this area, I have an expertise with

* Computer Vision
* Medical Image Analysis
* Machine learning

To be specific, I have worked and am interested in the following areas:

* Transformers 
* Generative Modeling (GANs, VAEs, GFlowNets)
* Self-Supervised Learning
* Medical Image Segmentation

I am always happy to discuss research-related topics. Just shoot me an email! :)
